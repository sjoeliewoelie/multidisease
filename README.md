# Multi-Disease Treatment Monitoring Platform

A comprehensive, multi-disease, multi-entity, and multilingual platform for remote treatment monitoring with automated rule-based workflows and task management.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This platform is built as a monorepo with the following components:

### Core Features
- **Multi-Disease Support**: Configurable disease modules (diabetes, hypertension, cardiac conditions, etc.)
- **Multi-Entity Management**: Healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, administrators
- **Multilingual Interface**: i18n support for global deployment
- **Remote Monitoring**: Real-time patient data collection and analysis
- **Rule Engine**: Automated workflows and alert systems
- **Task Management**: Automated and manual task assignment and tracking
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based notifications and updates

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material-UI, Socket.io-client
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and real-time data
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Monitoring**: Winston logging, Prometheus metrics
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes support
